Following this tutorial:[link](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) + [Source code](https://github.com/snaptoken/kilo-src)

It's very well written. Check it out.

In this repo I added some minors features:
- Toggle between insert/visual mode like vim
- Navigate with : WASD, HJKL.
- Display line number
- Jump to line number

Original features:
- Display text file
- Navigate in files with arrows
- Search
- Text highlight

To run: 
- build: `make`
- openup: `./voila FILE_PATH`

TODO:
- [x] insert/visual mode
- [x] Navigate with WASD and HJKL
- [x] Add display line numbers
- [x] Jump to line
- [ ] Refine display line features, need to dynamically allocate number size
